# Presentation documentation

## Introduction (homepage in the background)

##### What we implemented

* We build a system that can organize the jobs and work force of a company. This gives the company a better over sight of their jobs as well as the ability to organize their workers among the jobs.

##### Why we decided to implement the application

* Our application targets firms such as those in the event sector, moving painting or construction companies. Basically any company where that supplies workers to take care of a task for another company. This application will help to assist the personnel managers to better organize their firm.

## Live demonstration

1. **Create new tenant**
   1. For demonstration purposes, we allow a tenant to register themselves to our PMS service just by filling out a minimal registration form. In a real world production, the tenant will have to set a meeting with our HR personnel to register their company.
   2. When the tenant registers, an entry in our database is made which separates him from other tenants.
2. **Login with new tenant**
   1. As already mentioned earlier, the personnel manager has two main functionalities.
      1. To organize the jobs and employees of the company. We'll first take a look at how the employees are managed.
3. **Invite employees**
   1. Ask for few emails
   2. To invite an employee to also use the company's PMS service, we will send a email invitation to the employee so that he can register himself.
   3. Now we will take a look at how jobs are organized
4. **Create 4-5 jobs**
   1. The personnel manager can create jobs with the date, a title, description of what the job entails, the location as well as the start and end time can be given.
   2. He/she also has to ability to edit a job as well as to delete any job from the system.
      1. Edit one job
      2. Delete one job
   3. Now we will log in with an employees account. First we'll need to accept the invitation we recently sent out
5. **Go to mail box and open invitation**
6. **Register employee**
7. **Log in with employee**
   1. In the banner one sees which company's PMS service is being used. Also one can see the name of the employee logged in.
   2. The employee has basically 3 important views, available jobs, applied jobs and upcoming jobs. This enables the employee to have a perfect over view of what is happening within the company, as well as any jobs that he/she will partake in.
   3. Apply to a job
8. **Switch to tenant**
   1. Select the job the employee applied to. Now we have an overview of the jobs details as well as a list with the employees we selected for the job on the left, as well as a list of employees who applied for this specific job on the right. The personnel manager now has the ability to choose who he would like to work on said job. Select employee
9. **Switch back to employee**
   1. As one can see, the job is no longer available in the available jobs list, it has been moved to the upcoming jobs list because the employee has been selected.
10. As one can see, both the personnel manager as well as the employee has perfect overview of their work flow which raises the organization within the company drastically. There is no more hassle in organizing a work force for a job with our system.
11. **Features to come**
    1. New features that are to be implemented is the job history view of both employee and tenant so that they not only have an over view of the present jobs, but also a documentation of the jobs that happened in the past. The employee will also have a salary report which summarizes the jobs he did in the month as well as his earnings. A calender view will also be implemented which will create a much even better overview for the employee.
