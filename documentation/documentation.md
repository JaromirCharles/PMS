## Operations

### Adding a new tenant

### Installing application on the cloud provider

### DevOps approach
As a team of 2 developers, we utilized `GitHub` to manage the changes made to the source code as well as for collaboration. To keep track of what needs to be done within the project, we used GitHubs project boards so that the team has an overview of what needs to be done, what is currently in progress, what needs to be reviewed and what has already been done. **INSERT PICTURE??**.
